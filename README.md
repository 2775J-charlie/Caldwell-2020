# Caldwell-2020
The repository for 2775J's VRC Change Up code. May be replaced later, as we're still learning how to use GitHub and might screw it up.

When you are coding a new part of the program, please refrain from directly pushing to the master branch. Instead, please code all of
your work in a new branch, and then create a pull request. Otherwise, the purpose of using a version manager is defeated.

Thank you!
